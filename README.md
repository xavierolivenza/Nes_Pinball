# Things we don't implement from the original game

- Intro, end screens

- Map divided in two

- Top left piston doesn't add score, always 100pts.

- Pink staff didn't add 10pts.

- When you take all coins map turns purple and seals start dancing and adding points

- Special level

- When you enter the tunnel near the green part, the numbers over the penguins appear, 
rolling between 3 and 7, if you hit the pink board with a hit to the ball from the paddles, 
you can stop each number, and get a bonus
